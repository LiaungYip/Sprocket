# Sprocket
Configuration Utility for Custom Ore Gen: First Revival mod

The Custom Ore Generation mod for Minecraft is one of the best
discoveries I've made to this point.

However, it is apparent that the XML files it requires are a
particularly tricky thing to deal with; to properly configure COG, you
need to spend a lot of time writing a large XML file with a lot of
sections and options, just to get it to work with one or two ores.  On
the other hand, if you have a mod with a lot of ores, such as
Metallurgy or Nether Ores, this can turn into a major hassle in a
hurry... especially when you spend the better part of a week simply
hunting down a missing angle bracket or misspelled element!

Enter Sprocket.  With Sprocket, you can get a baseline XML file built
in a short time, just by making an INI file with the key information
for each ore and the mod.  Then, by running Sprocket on the config
file, a fully-valid, basic XML file is generated, essentially giving
you a shortcut to the point where you simply need to tweak the file
for the needed settings.
