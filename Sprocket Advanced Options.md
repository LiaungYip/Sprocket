# Sprocket INI Options

## Option Types:

* **List**: A comma-separated list of items.  Can also use regular expressions.
* **Value**: a single value only
* **Boolean**: A simple "yes" or "no" will suffice.
* **Statistical Variation**: This option consists of four values.
    * The *statistical average*.
    * The *statistical deviation*.
    * Preference, consisting of _one of the following_:
        * **normal** (prefers to stay closer to the average)
        * **inverse** (prefers to stay closer to the deviation)
        * **uniform** (no preference, completely random)
    * *Scaling option* (see COG's documentation for more details), usually defaults to "base".

## Distribution Meta Options

These options apply, regardless of the preset, and are useful in adding special logic to the XML that apply in specific circumstances.  They also include some universal values that can be applied if not overridden by distribution-specific options.

### Distribution Presets (List)

This is a list of all distributions presets available for this distribution.  (List of available distribution presets are a work in progress)

     Default: Vanilla

### Seed (Value)

The seed value is used to synchronize the random number generator between two or more distributions; this is useful when placing distributions inside other distributions.

     Default: MISSING

### Active (Boolean)

If Active is set to "no," then the default distribution is set to "none."  Otherwise, the default distribution is the first option in the distribution presets list.

     Default: yes

### Size (Statistical Variation)

This is a generic size range, used by all unconfigured distribution options.

     Default: _default_, _default_, normal, base

### Frequency (Statistical Variation)

This is a generic frequency range, used by all unconfigured distribution options.

     Default: _default_, _default_, normal, base

### Height (Statistical Variation)

This is a generic height range, used by all unconfigured distribution options.

     Default: _default_, _default_, normal, base

### Density (Statistical Variation)

This is a generic density range, used by all unconfigured distribution options.

     Default: _default_, _default_, normal, base

### Parent Range Limit (Statistical Variation)

This is a generic parent range limit range, used by all unconfigured distribution options.

     Default: _default_, _default_, normal, base

### Main Block Cleanup (Boolean)

If set to "yes," then the configuration will first undergo a "cleaning" step, in which all existing blocks in the "Blocks" list will be replaced by the first block in the "Replaces" list.  This removes ores generated by other mods in order to prepare the way for the new generation.

Setting this to "no" is recommended if the mod has configuration options that can disable its own oregen, as this can improve new chunk generation performance.

     Default: yes

### Alternate Block Cleanup (Boolean)

If set to "yes," then the configuration will first undergo a "cleaning" step, in which all existing blocks in the "Alternate Blocks" list will be replaced by the first block in the "Replaces" list.  This removes ores generated by other mods in order to prepare the way for the new generation.

Setting this to "no" is recommended if the mod has configuration options that can disable its own oregen, as this can improve new chunk generation performance.

     Default: no
     
## Block Lists

### Blocks (List)

List of block IDs that will be placed in the distribution.  This option *must be supplied*.

     Default: MISSING

### Alternate Blocks (List)

List of block IDs that will be placed in special locations in the distribution.  This option is only useful in complex distributions like pipes (it fills the pipe with the alternate blocks), compound veins, and geodes (both compound vein and geode are surrounded by the alternate blocks in a custom shell).

     Default: minecraft:stone

### Replaces (List)

The blocks that get replaced with the "Blocks" blocks.

     Default: minecraft:stone

### Block Weights (List)

Adjusts the weight values of the blocks in the "Blocks" list.  Must always be the same number of values as the "Blocks" list, and must always total 1 or less.

     Default: MISSING

### Alternate Block Weights (List)

Adjusts the weight values of the blocks in the "Alternate Blocks" list.  Must always be the same number of values as the "Alternate Blocks" list, and must always total 1 or less.

     Default: MISSING

### Replacement Weights (List)

Adjusts the weight values of the blocks in the "Replaces" list.  Must always be the same number of values as the "Alternate Blocks" list.  Unlike the previous two, the numbers do not have any specific total requirements.  However, a value of "1" means that the block is *always* replaced, and a value of "-1" means that the block is *never* replaced.

     Default: MISSING

## Location Options

### Dimensions (List)

List of dimensions for the current distribution.  Current options are -1 (Nether), 0 (Overworld), and 1 (End).  Other numbers can be added, but won't be used.

     Default: 0

### Need Biomes (List)

List of biomes; these are the only biomes the distribution will work for.

     Default: .*

### Need Biome Types (List)

List of Forge biome dictionary types; these are the only biome types the distribution will work for.

     Default: MISSING

### Avoid Biome Types (List)

List of Forge biome dictionary types; these are the biome types the distribution will *not* work for.

     Default: MISSING

### Prefer Biomes (List)

     Default: MISSING

### Biome Temperature Range (List)

Two numeric values indicate the minimum and maximum temperature required for the biome to qualify for the distribution.

### Place Below (List)

List of block IDs.  Block will only be placed if it is connected to the bottom surface of one of these blocks.

     Default: MISSING

### Place Beside (List)

List of block IDs.  Block will only be placed if it is connected to the side surface of one of these blocks.

     Default: MISSING
