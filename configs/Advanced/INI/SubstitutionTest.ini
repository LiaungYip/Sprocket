# Sprocket Configuration File to nuke all sand and dirt to glass. 

# This is included as an example of a substitution distribution, and
# can also be used as a test to see if the Custom Ore Generation mod
# is working correctly.
# NOTE: "Main Block Cleanup: no" means that the "Blocks" will not be
#       cleared first, which should reduce heavy performance loss.
